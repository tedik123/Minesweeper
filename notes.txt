more or less finished connecting as a client and hosting a server
Now we need to do the logic for the basic set up
//1. need to display the different boards
//2. share the boards on generation (I think this is complete)
//3. Live update tile reveals
//4. Live update flags
# Stopped here
5. Game won signal/game lost
        There should be tiered winning
        Server can save who's won and lost so far, only wins will be counted in the tiered list
        Wins should be based on time, which is client based, so sort by time
        Losers will have their own category
        Once everyone has won or lost display a pop up?
6. Game won/lost dialogue including allowing for replay and difficulty updates
7. UI changes; such as adding people's usernames; disabling difficulty for everyone but the host?
8. Disabling interaction of other player boards (buttons complete; need combo box and timer fix)
8. Complete????????
