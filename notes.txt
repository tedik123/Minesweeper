more or less finished connecting as a client and hosting a server
Now we need to do the logic for the basic set up
1. need to display the different boards
2. share the boards on generation (I think this is complete)
3. Live update tile reveals
4. Live update flags
5. Game won signal/game lost
6. Game won/lost dialogue including allowing for replay and difficulty updates
7. UI changes; such as adding people's usernames; disabling difficulty for everyone but the host?
7. Complete????????
